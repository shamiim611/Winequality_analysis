# Winequality_analysis
Project: Wine Quality Prediction
This project utilizes a dataset of 1599 rows and 12 columns to analyze and predict wine quality based on physicochemical attributes. The goal is to determine the key factors influencing wine quality and evaluate the predictive performance of a linear regression model.
Key Steps:
•	Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
•	Correlation Analysis: Generated a correlation table and heatmap to explore relationships between variables.
•	Model Training: Built a multiple linear regression model to predict wine quality and identify important predictors.
•	Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of the regression model using relevant metrics.
This project demonstrates skills in data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA),checking multicollinerity using VIF machine learning model building, and performance evaluation.
